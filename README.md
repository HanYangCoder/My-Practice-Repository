# My-Practice-Repository
So this is my practice repository, don't mind this I'm just practicing my git commands here lol.

Hello there! So there is not much we can do here, I'm just practicing here so if like to decorate it just hit me up with a request! :v:

    Update: So I dunno what I'm doing here XD
    I wanna add a student class here or something to make changes
    I'm on my virtual machine right now (I'm using Pop!_OS as guest and Win10 as host)
    Probably just wanna practice updating my code from different machines

    So I added a score reader where you can input your score and it will determine if you passed or fail
    A score of 50-100 is passing and below that you will have to take the exam again.
    Also renamed my main file from helloWorld.java to practiceMain.java
}


so I added a simple java "Hello World" program so I could play with java files here too since I know a little about java.
