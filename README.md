# My-Practice-Repository
So this is my practice repository, don't mind this I'm just practicing my git commands here lol.

Hello there! So there is not much we can do here, I'm just practicing here so if like to decorate it just hit me up with a request! :v:

so I added a simple java "Hello World" program so I could play with java files here too since I know a little about java.
